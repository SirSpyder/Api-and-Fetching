Project Description :
  this project was designed to help me iwth Api and fetching it was the first time messing with thses concepts.

Technologies used:
  Jsong server and vs studio for the code as well as java bootstrap and hmtl are the file types and code types

Faviorite Features:
  I really enjoy the json server its really cool to launch a local server to test a api and fecthing just to see how a back end roughly works and how front end interacts with that

Disclamier:
  still really new to coding and messing with api and fecthing
